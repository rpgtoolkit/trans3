<!-- Board Editor rewrite - 18 September 2006 by Delano -->

<img src="images/image47" alt="Board editor" />
<p>
The board editor may be broken down into a number of sections: the New Board screen, the Board 

and Properties tabs, the left-hand toolbar, the right-hand toolbar and the menus.
</p>
<a name="newboard"></a><h3>New Board screen</h3>
<p>
After opening the board editor (see <a href="pageed_environment.htm">Editor Environment</a> for 

ways to do this), you will be presented with the 'New Board' options window, which allows you to 

specify the properties of the new board. 
</p>
<img src="images/image86" alt="New board window" />
<ul>
	<li>The option buttons allow you to either choose a new set of parameters or to load a 

pre-existing board - for instance, you could create a template board with a number of common 

properties and specify it here.
	</li>
	<li>The coordinate system choices specify the grid and perspective of the board; see the 

<a href="page4.htm">Board Basics page</a> for a description of the choices. Once the coordinate system is 

set you cannot alter it, except to upgrade from isometric stacked to rotated, or from tile to 

pixel (see Menu below).
	</li>
	<li>The X and Y dimensions are always specified in tile values, even if the 'Use pixel 

coordinates' option is ticked. The resulting pixel dimensions of the board are specified below 

the tile dimensions.
	</li>
	<li>The Background Image may be any type of non-tile image file, and is drawn below the 

first layer of tiles.
	</li>
	<li>This window remembers all its settings, so if you tick the 'Do not show this form on 

startup' box, a new board will be automatically created with the last set of parameters. To 

reshow the form, choose the relevant option in the Board > Preferences... menu.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Board Tab</h3>
<p>
After selecting 'OK' on the New Board window, a black area will appear in the middle of the 

screen (unless a background image or pre-existing board was selected!); this is the board showing 

its default background colour.
</p>
<a name="lefttoolbar"></a><h3>Left-hand Toolbar</h3>
<p>
The toolbar on the left-hand side contains the tools used to draw and edit the various objects 

placed on the board. Each button has a keyboard shortcut key, denoted in brackets.
</p><p>
The first is a set of general tools:
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/image0" alt="Grid icon" /></td>
		<td>
			Grid On/Off (G) - Toggles drawing of the tile grid.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/image87" alt="Undo icon" /></td>
		<td>
			Undo (Ctrl+Z) - Undoes the last user operation. Only the most relevant 

operations are undoable; a multiple-undo stack is maintained, so multiple operations up to a 

particular number can be undone.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/image8" alt="Autotiler icon" /></td>
		<td>
			Toggle Auto-Tiler (H) - Auto-Tiling is an option found in some RPG makers 

that uses specially drawn and arranged tilesets to make the task of creating bounded tile areas 

simpler. To use this feature you must have an auto-tile tileset open. This option turns 

auto-tiling on or off - turned off, you can place auto-tiles normally, when turned on any tiles 

placed form enclosed areas dependent on their neighbouring tiles. Auto-tilesets must either be 

downloaded or created using the "Auto-Tiler" tool - follow <a 

href="http://toolkitzone.com/fileman.php?id=3&amp;file=865" rel="external">this link</a> for more 

information.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
The second group of tools are associated with creating and editing each particular object type. 

The buttons are interlinked so that only one can be selected at any one time. The specific action 

on each object is then determined by the selected button in the third group. When one of the last 

six buttons is selected (vector to lighting), the currently selected object of that type is 

highlighted on the board, indicated either by a thick line for vectors or a bounding box for 

sprites and images.
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="images/image88" alt="Scroll icon" /></td>
		<td>
			Scroll board (Q) - Allows the board to be scrolled using the mouse 

buttons. Left-click and hold (LMB) on the board and drag the mouse to scroll the board.
<br /> 
Tip: Scrolling can also be achieved at any time by using the mouse wheel. Scrolling the wheel 

causes either horizontal or vertical scrolling; clicking the middle mouse button/wheel (MMB) 

switches between horizontal or vertical scrolling. The Scroll board tool need not be selected to 

do this.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="images/image89" alt="Zoom icon" /></td>
		<td>
			Zoom (W) - Allows the board to be zoomed in or out. LMB zooms in, 

right-click (RMB) zooms out. A finite number of zoom levels are provided.
<br />
Tip: Zooming can also be achieved by scrolling the mouse wheel whilst holding the Ctrl key down. 

The Zoom tool need not be selected to do this.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/image90" alt="Tile icon" /></td>
		<td>
			Tile tools (T) - Selects tile editing. Note the current tileset can be 

opened in a pop-up browser by pressing the 'L' key.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/image91" alt="Vector icon" /></td>
		<td>
			Vector tools (V) - Selects vector editing (including collision and 

waypoint, excluding program).
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/image92" alt="Program vector icon" /></td>
		<td>
			Program tools (P) - Selects program vector editing (excluding threads).
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/image93" alt="Sprite icon" /></td>
		<td>
			Sprite tools (S) - Selects sprite (item) editing.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/image94" alt="Image icon" /></td>
		<td>
			Image tools (I) - Selects image editing (excluding background image).
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/image95" alt="Shading icon" /></td>
		<td>
			Shading tools (Y) - Selects tile shading editing (excluding ambient 

levels and lighting).
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/image96" alt="Lighting icon" /></td>
		<td>
			Lighting tools (U) - Selects light editing (excluding ambient levels).
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
The third is a group of generic tools whose function and action depend on the selected button of 

the second group. Note: when the selected button in the second group is changed, the selected 

tool in the third group defaults to Draw. Not all tools are applicable to all objects, those that 

are not are disabled when the object's button is selected.
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/image97" alt="Draw icon" /></td>
		<td>
			Draw (D)
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>
<ul>
<li>Tile: 
	<ul>
	<li>LMB - Places the currently selected tile on the selected layer at the location 

clicked. If a tile bitmap (.tbm) is selected, the tiles of the tbm are placed onto the board, 

with the top-left tile placed at the location clicked. The tile bitmap itself is not associated 

with the board in any way.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Vector, Program: 
	<ul>
	<li>LMB - Creates a new vector and sets the first point by entering 'drawing mode'. A 

dashed line extends to the mouse pointer, and subsequent LMB clicks draw new points on the 

vector. If the coordinate system is not in pixels, vector points are placed at gridpoints.</li>
	<li>RMB - If in 'drawing mode', a RMB <i>closes</i> the vector by joining the first and 

last points and exits drawing mode (a subsequent LMB will start a new vector). A LMB near the 

first point does not have the same effect.</li>
	<li>RMB+Ctrl - If in 'drawing mode', exits drawing mode without closing the vector.</li>
	<li>LMB+Ctrl - If in a pixel coordinate system, causes vector points to snap to 

gridpoints; if in tile coordinate system, prevents snap-to-gridpoints.</li>
	<li>LMB+Shift - If in drawing mode, aligns the next point to the nearest axis or 

diagonal.</li>
	<li>LMB+Alt - When not in drawing mode, edits the selected vector in the following ways:
		<ul>
		<li>If click is near a point, the point is deleted (where 'near' means within ~16 

pixels).</li>
		<li>If click is near a line and far from a point, the line is subdivided and a 

new point is created.</li>
		<li>If click is far from a line, drawing mode is entered and a new point added to 

the end of the vector and the vector is unclosed.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Sprite, Image, Light:
	<ul>
	<li>LMB - Creates a new sprite, image or light, respectively. The new object is blank or 

is given the default parameters for its type. Blank sprites and images are represented by 32x32 

pixel black or white squares. If tile coordinates are selected, a sprite is aligned to the grid. 

Lights are represented by vectors as well as by the shades they cast.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Shading:
	<ul>
	<li>LMB - Places the currently selected shade on the shading layer at the location 

clicked. If any tiles are on layers below the shading layer at the same location, the shade is 

applied to them.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

		<li>Creates a selection box that resizes to align with the grid.</li>
		<li>Performed on a selection box, causes the selected tiles to be moved to the 

new location (equivalent to a Cut-Paste operation).</li>
		<li>LMB+Ctrl+drag on a selection causes the original tiles to be preserved 

(equivalent to a Copy-Paste operation).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>RMB - Erases the selection box.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Vector, program:
	<ul>
	<li>LMB - Highlights (selects) the nearest vector (by the nearest point, rather than 

line).</li>
	<li>LMB+drag - Draws a selection box. If any points of the selected vector fall inside 

the box, a number of operations can be performed on these selected points.
		<ul>
		<li>LMB+drag - Moves/drags selected points.</li>
		<li>(Del, Backspace) - Deletes selected points.</li>
		<li>(Z) - Subdivides selected lines. If two or more consecutive points are 

selected, new points are created at the midpoints of selected lines.</li>
		<li>(X) - Extends selected point. If the vector is not closed and the start or 

end point is selected, drawing mode is entered beginning from the selected point.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>RMB - Erases the selection box.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Sprite, Image:
	<ul>
	<li>LMB - Highlights (selects) the targeted object.</li>
	<li>LMB+drag - If originating within the selected object's bounds, drags/moves the 

selected object. If in tile coordinates, sprites are forced to align to the grid.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Shading: Controls are identical to the tile controls listed above.
</li>
<li>Lighting: Light vectors can be edited in the same way as other vectors with the exception 

that points cannot be added or deleted.

<p style="text-align: left;">[ <a href="#">top</a> ]</p>

<a name="righttoolbar"></a><h3>Right-hand Toolbar</h3>

<p>
The right-hand toolbar contains three permanent buttons that are described on the <a 

href="pageed_environment.htm">Editor Environment page</a>. When the board editor is open, a fourth 

button appears - this is the <i>Board Toolbar</i>, and displays the properties of all the objects 

on the board.
<br /> 
The toolbar has five tabs, one for each object group: vectors, programs, sprites, images and 

lighting. Selecting one of these tools from the left-hand toolbar causes the matching tab to be 

shown on the Board Toolbar. The first four tabs contain a drop-down box listing all the current 

objects of that type on the board. The properties of the selected object are then displayed in 

the panel below. Each of the first four tabs also contains a checkbox to toggle whether the 

objects of that type are displayed in the board editor, and a 'Delete' button to erase the 

currently selected object. The currently selected object is highlighted if the object type's 

button is selected in the left-hand toolbar. If no objects of the type exist, all controls on the 

tab are disabled.
</p><p>
Tip: The Board Toolbar can be hidden or shown using the Ctrl+B shortcut. The tileset toolbar can 

be hidden or shown using Ctrl+L. A pop-up tileset browser can also be displayed by pressing L 

when the board has the focus.
</p>
<h4>Vectors (Alt+V)</h4>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="images/image107" alt="Vector tab" /></td>
		<td valign="top">
<ul>
<li>The vectors tab displays information for all vector types except programs.</li>
<li>The drop-down list displays the <i>index</i> and <i>handle</i> of the each vector. Both index 

and handle can be used to access a vector in RPGCode. Click the text area of the drop-down list 

to begin entering a new handle for the current vector (do not enter the index or colon first, 

these are automatically added). Two vectors cannot share the same index or handle.</li>
<li>Solid, under, stairs and waypoint: valid vector types; see <a href="page4.2.htm">link</a> for a full a 

description of each.</li>
<li>Closed vector: Determines whether the vector forms a closed loop or not.</li>
<li>Include background: A sprite standing on an under-vector on any layer will appear 'behind' 

the background image, if one exists.</li>
<li>Include all layers below: A sprite will appear behind any tiles or images on any layers below 

an under-vector, in addition to those on the current layer.</li>
<li>Trigger on frame intersect: The sprite will appear behind an under-vector area when its 

<i>image frame</i> intersects the vector, rather than its collision vector. See <a href="page4.2.htm">this 

link</a> for an example of its usage.</li>
<li>Layer: layer the vector is located upon; sprites will only interact with a vector if it is on 

the same layer as the sprite.</li>
<li>Stairs to layer: Layer to move sprites to when they intersect a stair-vector.</li>
<li>Slot index: The numeric index of the vector on the board, as shown in the drop-down list. Use 

the buttons to move the current vector up or down in the list.</li>
<li>Points list: a list of the vector's points in pixel coordinates. In order to change a point's 

coordinates:
	<ul>
	<li>click the value to be changed;</li>
	<li>press the Delete or Backspace key;</li>
	<li>enter the new coordinate;</li>
	<li>press the Enter key.</li>
	</ul>
To delete a point, click the point's index in the first column and press the Delete or Backspace 

key. Vector points are always stored in pixel coordinates regardless of the board's coordinate 

system.</li>

cannot be edited via the drop-down box. If no filename/code is given '&lt;program&gt;' is 

displayed, and the program will not be loaded in the engine.</li> 
<li>Program filename/inline RPGCode: Specify a program's filename or a line of RPGCode to run 

when the program is activated. Use the '...' button to the right to browse for programs, and the 

blank button below to open the program, if the file exists. When specifying a program, it must 

exist within the game's 'Prg\' folder or subfolders within it. If the program is in a subfolder 

then subfolder's name must also appear in the textbox (e.g., for the file 'Prg\system\pause.prg', 

the text 'system\pause.prg' should be written). When specifying subfolders, only the '\' slash is 

valid; the '/' is not. These principles apply when choosing any files in subfolders throughout 

the Toolkit.</li> 
<li>Layer: layer the program is located upon; players will only interact with a program if it is 

on the same layer as the player.</li> 
<li>Activation by step-on: The program will run as soon as a player walks onto (intersects with) 

the program's vector.</li> 
<li>Activation by key-press: The program will run only when the player is standing on or in the 

program's vector and the user presses the activation key (see <a href="page3.htm">Main File 

Editor</a>).</li> 
<li>Trigger every x pixels: Causes the program to run after a player has walked a given number of 

pixels in or on a program vector. When the user leaves the vector, the count is reset.</li> 
<li>Activation stops movement: Running the program causes the player to stop moving (for 

instance, when using mouse movement).</li> 
<li>Run once: Causes the program to be run only once for the entire duration of the game.</li> 
<li>Run program if variable 'x' = 'y': Causes the program to be run only if the RPGCode variable 

specified in the first box has the value specified in the second box. Cannot be used in 

conjunction with the 'Run Once' checkbox.</li>
<li>After program finishes, set variable 'x' = 'z': Optional - when the program ends, the RPGCode 

variable named in the first box is given the value in the second.</li>

<li>Sprite filename: Filename of the item (players cannot currently be specified). Click the 

'...' button to browse for an item, and the blank button to open the file, if it exists.</li>
<li>Location: The x, y and layer coordinates of the sprite. Given in tile coordinates unless 

using pixel coordinates. If using tile coordinates, sprites are 'snapped' to the grid. When using 

pixel coordinates, the x, y values refer to the bottom-centre of the sprite's frame. For 

historical reasons, in isometric mode, the y-value is offset down by 8 pixels.</li>
<li>Slot index: The numeric index of the sprite on the board, as shown in the drop-down list. Use 

the buttons to move the current sprite up or down in the list.</li>
<li>Override program to run on activation: Specify a program or a line of RPGCode to run when the 

user interacts with the sprite, instead of any program specified in the item's Board Options (see

<li>Show sprite when board loads if variable 'x' = 'y': Causes the sprite to be visible only if 

the RPGCode variable specified in the first box has the value specified in the second box. The 

sprite's data is still loaded and the sprite can be shown at any time using PutItem().</li>
<li>Run program if variable 'x' = 'y': Causes the sprite's activation program to be run only if 

the RPGCode variable specified in the first box has the value specified in the second box.</li>

<h4>Lighting (Alt+L)</h4>
<table>

		<td valign="top"><img src="images/image111" alt="Lighting tab" /></td>
		<td valign="top">
The lighting tab contains information for both tile shading and lighting.
<ul>
<li>Cast onto tiles on layer x and below: specifies the layer above which the tile shading layer 

and any lights are positioned. This style of lighting and shading cannot be applied to images and 

cannot be applied at a sub-tile level.</li>
<li>Lighting: the first drop-down box lists the current lights on the board by their index and 

light type. The selected light is displayed here, and if the lighting button is selected on the 

left-hand toolbar, the selected light's vector is highlighted on the board.</li>
<li>The smaller drop-down box lists the possible light types of the current light. These are:
	<ul>
	<li>Elliptic spotlight: Creates a circular or elliptic spotlight defined by three points 

and two colours. Its vector consists of two lines defining the semi-major and semi-minor axes 

(whichever is longer and shorter, respectively). The angle of the semi-minor axis with respect to 

the semi-major is immaterial, only its length is used. One colour is applied to the centre of the 

ellipse and one to the boundary, and all points in the ellipse are shaded with a gradated mix of 

the two colours.</li>
	<li>Gradient: A linear gradient that fills the whole screen, defined by two points and 

two colours. The gradient is applied in parallel to the line joining the points, extending 

perpendicularly across the whole board. Beyond either point, the board is shaded with the colour 

of the closer point.</li>
	<li>Clipped gradient: Similar to Gradient, the Clipped gradient extends perpendicularly 

across the whole board, but is clipped in the parallel direction at either point.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>The next section defines the colours of the current light. 
	<ul>
	<li>A colour box displays the shade.</li>
	<li>'...' button sets the shade for this point to the Current Shade (see below).</li>
	<li>The accompanying text describes the associated point of the light and its RGB (red, 

green, blue) value.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Convert: Converts the light to tile shading by rendering the light to the tile shading layer. 

The light is combined additively with any current tile shading and the light object is removed 

from the board. Once the light is removed, its shape cannot be altered.</li>
<li>Delete: Removes the current light from the board.</li>
<li>Current Shade: displays the shade used for drawing tile shading and for assigning shades to 

lights.
	<ul>
	<li>RGB textboxes: Individual RGB values can be input in the range -255 to +255. Positive 

numbers lighten tiles and negative numbers darken.</li>
	<li>Slider: Sets the RGB to the same value.</li>
	<li>Zero RGB: Sets the RGB to [0, 0, 0].</li>

<p>
The properties tab displays miscellaneous attributes of the board not associated with the objects 

listed above.
</p>
<img src="images/image112" alt="Properties tab" />
<ul>
<li>Directional links: When the player reaches the edge of a board they may move to a new 

location. One way of doing this is to specify a directional link for that edge of the board; one 

textbox is provided for each edge or direction. A program may instead be run when the player 

reaches the edge. Click the '...' button to browse for a board or program file, and the blank 

button to open the file, if it exists.
</li>
<li>Background image: Specify a non-tile image for the background; click the '...' to browse for 

a file (files must be located in the 'Bitmap\' folder or subfolders therein.
</li>
<li>Background color: The colour of the board beneath the background image and tiles, defaulting 

to black. Click the '...' to select a colour.
</li>
<li>Background music: Specify a music file that plays and loops for the duration the player is on 

the board; click the '...' to browse for a file (files must be located in the 'Media\' folder or 

subfolders therein.
</li>
<li>Threads: As mentioned in <a href="page4.htm">Board Basics</a>, threads are programs that are run in 

the background of the game and allow gameplay to continue whilst they execute, in contrast to 

other programs. A set of board threads may be specified here that are launched when the board is 

entered and terminated when the board is left, unless they have already done so. Use the 'Add...' 

and 'Remove' buttons to create or delete board threads, and the 'Open' button to open the 

selected file, if it exists.
</li>
<li>Dimensions: Width and Height describe the dimensions of the board in <i>tiles</i> at all 

times. The coordinate system types are displayed but cannot be altered (except through the menu 

option, see below).
</li>
<li>Constants: Two arrays of RPGCode constants may be defined on a board. One is a set of generic 

constants that can be used to hold any data, entitled 'constant[x]' where x is a number (see <a 

href="page18.5.htm">RPGCode Reference</a>). The second is a set of strings that may hold the names 

or titles for each layer (but may hold anything else you need), entitled 'boardtitle[x]' where x 

is a number. To create a new constant, select the blank entry from the end of the drop-down list. 

The number of boartitle[] constants is fixed to the number of layers (when changing the number of 

layers, switch back to the Board tab to update this list). The value of the selected constant is 

displayed in the accompanying textbox.
</li>
<li>Battle settings:
	<ul>
	<li>Enable fighting on this board: Check this box to allow random battles to occur at the 

frequency or probability determined in the <a href="page3.htm">Main File Editor</a>.</li>
	<li>Board skill: Sets the skill level of enemies encountered during random battles, as 

assigned to enemies in the Main File Editor.</li>
	<li>Battle background: The .bkg background file to display when running random 

battles.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Disable progress saving: one can prevent players from saving their game on the current board 

by enabling this option - for instance, if you don't want them to be able to save during a series 

of battles. With this option enabled, the "Save" option in the default menu is inactive. 
</li>
<li>Program to run when entering board: set this if you want a program to run as soon as the 

player steps onto the board, before he is allowed to move. Note that any board threads are 

launched before this program is run.
</li>
<li>Ambient RGB: A uniform shade that is applied to the board. These values combine additively 

with the global Ambient Level applied through setAmbientLevel(). Individual red, green and blue 

values are specified in the range -255 to +255, where negative numbers darken and positive 

numbers lighten the scene. Useful for creating dark rooms, for instance.

<h4>Edit</h4>
<ul>
<li>Undo (Ctrl+Z): Undoes the last action; a multiple undo stack is provided storing a certain 

number of previous changes. Not all operations are undoable.</li>
<li>Redo (Ctrl+Y): Redoes an Undo action.</li>
<li>Copy (Ctrl+C): Copies the selected object to the board clipboard. A selection of the desired 

object(s) must be made using the Selection tool on the left-hand toolbar. The object type 

corresponding to the selected object button on the left-hand toolbar is copied. Groups of tiles 

and shades can be copied, or whole vectors, programs sprites and images. Partial vectors (point 

groups) and lights cannot be copied. In addition, text in textboxes can be copied, cut and pasted 

from outside the editor.</li>
<li>Cut (Ctrl+X): Cuts the currently selected object.</li>
<li>Paste (Ctrl+V): Pastes the current object on the clipboard.</li>
<li>Select All (Ctrl+A): Creates a selection box around the current object, or around the whole 

board (in tile or shading mode).</li>

	<li>Show vector indices: Draw numbers by the points of vectors.</li>
	<li>Use recursive flooding: If you experience problems with the flood tool, such as tiles 

being erased rather than placed, enable this option. This may happen on earlier versions of 

Windows. Note that with this option enabled, you cannot flood large boards (approximately greater 

than 100x100). This option is linked to the option in the <a href="page5.htm">Tile Editor</a>.</li>
	<li>Show New Board dialog window: Show the New Board window when opening the board 

editor.</li>
	<li>Show player start location on initial board only: display the starting location only 

if the board's name matches the initial board specified in the main file editor, otherwise the 

start locations (if defined) are displayed on each board.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Set Player Start Location (Ctrl+D): Use this to set the location where the player will begin 

at the beginning of the game. Choose this option and then click the required position on the 

board. The location is highlighted by a cross and text detailing the chosen layer. If tile 

coordinates are used, the location will snap to a grid square.</li>
<li>Set As Initial Board (Ctrl+G): Alters the initial board field in the main file to the current 

board's name.</li>
